# BrooderSite1
This site is developed to help handeling the brooder throug the web.
We have used bootstrap in order to make rubber-site
We have also used the MDB framework in order to do animation see this link for more detail https://mdbootstrap.com/css/animations/
We used only two files index.html and set_my.html in order to make easy to load project on controller.
We have used CDN for bootstrap and MDB css and js files. See this link https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/mdbootstrap?path=js&tab=collection
Hope this web page will help to protect chickens from stress!)))
